## Remotely Connecting
To remotely connect you would start by downloading a program called [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse). This program is specific to Windows users.Then you are going to connect remotely through VScode, so you have to open the application up. Once VScode is open you are going to enter your course-specific account in the command line of your terminal. You are then going to enter your password and end up with a screen that looks like:

## Trying Some Commands
To try some commands, you would simply type the command into the command line of your terminal. 
Here are a list of commands to get you started:
- cd: `changes to previous directory`
- cd~: `takes you to the home directory`
- ls: `lists the files in the current directory`
- Ls-l: `long listing(shows: who can read the file, chracter/bytes in file, date modified, etc)`
- Pwd: `prints the working directory(shows the file path)`
- Ssh: `secure shell`
- CP: `copy file`

After running a couple commands your terminal should look similar to this:
